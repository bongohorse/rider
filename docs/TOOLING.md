# Project tooling

[Documentation index](README.md) · [G2 state/blocker](G2_ACCEPTANCE.md)

Use the repository root. Bash and PowerShell wrappers forward to the same Python implementation:

```sh
bash tools/doctor.sh --json
bash tools/verify.sh --suite bootstrap --output artifacts/g2/bootstrap
bash tools/verify.sh --suite physics --target desktop --output artifacts/g2/physics
bash tools/verify.sh --suite physics --target html5 --output artifacts/g2/html5
bash tools/build.sh --target desktop --configuration debug
bash tools/build.sh --target html5 --configuration release
bash tools/build.sh --target android --configuration debug
```

Windows equivalents: `./tools/doctor.ps1`, `./tools/verify.ps1`, `./tools/build.ps1` with the same arguments. The doctor remains an explicit environment inventory; `--require-g1` requires JDK/Bob presence and never claims a Bridge connection or runtime approval. Builds additionally enforce the exact approved JDK build and Bob hash. Set PATH to Eclipse Temurin 25.0.4.1+1; Python >=3.12, Git and installed bootstrap requirements are needed. HTML5 runtime verification additionally needs `npm ci --ignore-scripts` and `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`.

`verify --suite physics` delegates to the existing G1 runner, then requires the two complete physics inventories and their scale/render comparison. It does not create another simulation loop. `verify --suite bootstrap` requires the project contract and actual nonzero bootstrap/protocol test counts. `build` produces debug/release bundles, with runner identity settings for the current PoC; it does not assert successful runtime, installation or game readiness.

Every invocation writes `results.json` (schema 1) and `junit.xml` alongside logs. Default output is `artifacts/g2/<uuid>/`. Exit 0=PASS, 1=FAIL, 2=BLOCKED. BLOCKED is a failing CI result, never green. Missing or duplicate expected IDs and zero inventory fail. JSON contains exact Git source, test IDs, status, measurements where available and relative artifact paths. Per-case physics timing is `null` (not measured); the overall runner duration is measured. `assertions: 1` counts the collector verdict for each reported case, not the number of internal Lua predicates. Timeouts kill process trees; incomplete physics cases are represented as failures. JSON/JUnit PASS is tooling evidence, not whole-G2 approval.

A real build regression is separate:

```sh
python tools/g2/negative_build.py --output artifacts/g2/negative-build
```

It copies the current project into a temporary directory, injects an invalid Lua statement, requires a build error naming that script, restores the exact original bytes, builds the restored copy successfully, and verifies the original working tree is unchanged. The broken copy is never committed. CI uploads both logs and the restoration report. Its Linux APK job also builds through the shared CLI, verifies the signature with Android `apksigner`, and parses the package with `aapt2`; these checks do not claim an actual device installation. The four CLI unit tests separately cover nonzero subprocess exits, zero-test rejection, timeout and incomplete inventory.

G1: native headless physics and HTML5 debug evidence. G2 Bridge/native-graphics and release-negative checks: blocked/unrun as shown in the acceptance file. Android APK build success does not prove installation or real device/touch behavior. No editor launch or local port/session is assumed by these commands.
